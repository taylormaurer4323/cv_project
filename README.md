If running mobilenet you want to checkout this repo:
https://github.com/taylormaurer4323/mobilestereonet.git

And you want this in the current folder.

The main scripts to run things are A) mobilenet_testing.py and B) mobilenet_training.py, they both call their respective classes contained within mobilenet_tester.py and mobilenet_trainer.py.
